# Computational Decoding of Dance Gestures

Dance is a long-standing form of human expression, used to convey emotions, tell stories, and entertain audiences. However, providing informative feedback on dance performances can be challenging due to the subjective nature of traditional descriptions. These descriptions are reliant upon the observer's personal interpretation of the dance movements, which can be heavily influenced by various factors such as their background and the context of the performance. This subjectivity can hinder the provision of comprehensive and impartial feedback, thereby impeding the dancers' growth in developing their artistic style and advancing the art form.

An essential element of dance is gestures, which are defined as movements made by the dancer to express a particular idea or emotion. These movements can range from subtle to overt and include various parts of the body, such as the hands, arms, head, and body. The two primary categories of gestures in dance are behavioral and expressive gestures. In this project, I aim to explore computational methods that can be used to describe a dance performance with a focus on gestures.

## Background Concepts

Below are some quick-reference resources, including Wikipedia articles and abstracts, that can help you gain a better understanding of the project.

* [Laban movement analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_movement_analysis) is a widely-used method in dance research, providing a comprehensive framework for describing, visualizing, and interpreting human movement patterns and expressive qualities in dance performances.
* [Pose estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pose_(computer_vision)) refers to the process of determining the spatial arrangement of key points or body parts (such as human joints) within an image or video, allowing for the extraction of valuable information about an object's position, orientation, and movement.
* [Gesture Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesture_recognition) is a topic in computer science and language technology with the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms.
* [Kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics) is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. The principles of kinematics are going to be used to detect and understand gestures in dance performance.
