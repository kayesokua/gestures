# Dance Gestures Analysis

## Overview

Dance is a long-standing form of human expression, used to convey emotions, tell stories, and entertain audiences. However, providing informative feedback on dance performances can be challenging due to the subjective nature of traditional descriptions. These descriptions are reliant upon the observer's personal interpretation of the dance movements, which can be heavily influenced by various factors such as their background and the context of the performance. This subjectivity can hinder the provision of comprehensive and impartial feedback, thereby impeding the dancers' growth in developing their artistic style and advancing the art form.

An essential element of dance is gestures, which are defined as movements made by the dancer to express a particular idea or emotion. These movements can range from subtle to overt and include various parts of the body, such as the hands, arms, head, and body. The two primary categories of gestures in dance are behavioral and expressive gestures. In this project, we aim to leverage the exploratory data analysis (EDA) technique to analyze the gestures observed in modern dance performances. Through this approach, we hope to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships across different categories of modern dance - that can be used to develop a machine-learning model that provides objective feedback.

## Research Questions

1. Can the movements and gestures used in modern dance performances be quantified and analyzed using computational methods?
2. Can insights gained from the EDA on modern dance be applied to create machine-learning models for generating feedback?
3. Are there any differences in the use of gestures based on the dancer's gender, ethnicity, or other demographic factors?
