    "# Expressive Gestures\n",
    "\n",
    "Laban/Bartenieff Movement Analysis (LMA) characterizes gestures as individual movements that convey meaning. In LMA, expressive gestures are defined as movements that convey emotions, intentions, or personal artistic expression, often characterized by their dynamic qualities, such as flow, weight, time, and space, which reflect the performer's inner state or interpretation of a theme. In this notebook, the same behavioral gestures will be analyzed to extract expressive qualities within these movements.\n",
