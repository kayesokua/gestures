    "Laban/Bartenieff Movement Analysis (LMA) characterizes gestures as individual movements that convey meaning. Within LMA, behavioral gestures can be seen as functional, everyday, or task-oriented movements. In this notebook, we will employ analytic and geometric methods to devise a rule-based system for identifying common behavioral gestures from extracted features. Since no existing model specifically addresses this task, we will begin with basic behavioral gestures such as *standing*, *sitting*, and *bending of knees*.\n",
