    "# Dance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Begin by summarizing the main features and characteristics of the dataset, such as the number of observations, variables, and data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Patterns\n",
    "Identify any patterns, trends, or relationships that you observed during the exploration. This could include distributions of variables, correlations between variables, or any other insights that you gained.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outliers\n",
    "Discuss any outliers, missing values, or anomalies that you found in the dataset and how you dealt with them during the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Uncertain\n",
    "Consider the limitations of the dataset and the EDA. What are the potential sources of bias, error, or uncertainty in the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions and Recommendations\n",
    "- Downloaded videos require manual inspection and further cleaning\n",
    "- Computational methods can be used for objective feedback but it needs more focus or less the computing will be too long for each video.\n",
    "- Current proposed system is inefficient and might not be good for a large amount of data.\n",
    "- Describing feedback in human readable terms will require a fushion of NLTK\n",
    "- Qualitative research amongst professional and amateur dancers could provide insight on the kind of feedback that is important."
